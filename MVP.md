**MVP** stands for *most valuable player*, referring to the player, which contributed most to the slay-down of a boss monster, which is itself often referred to as MVP as well. Boss monsters are the strongest monsters in [Ragnarok Online](/Ragnarok_Online "wikilink"), from which the MVP gets extra experience and special prizes right into their inventory for defeating, aside from normal drops.
